One of the greatest pleasures in life is spending time with children and
reminding yourself of how much fun simple things can be. Just today I
was holding my one-year old son and swinging around the room whilst
singing to a cover of Leonard Cohen's "Hallelujah" song. We were laughing
so much I was almost crying.
