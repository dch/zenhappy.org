Autumn is my favourite time of the year: warm but not hot, with abundant fruit and fresh vegetables, applejuice, pumpkin pies, and more jam than you could shake a stick at. Along with edibles, comes a feast of visuals. Green forests turn yellow, then brown, with a haze of colour that beggars imagination. Oranges and rustic reds duel it out with jaded faded greens, and a riotous golden glow is spread throughout with autumn sunshine. The days are long and warm, and the sunsets have a touch of purple and often force their way through layers of cloud scattered across the horizon.
