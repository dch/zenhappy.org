I vividly remember the first time I saw trees that lose their leaves over
winter. I was 14, and coming from a country with evergreens and very few
deciduous trees, I was shocked at what I perceived as extensive devastation.
The only place I'd seen this before was in war zones, after large explosions.

Many years later, I look forward to winter, and to the stark beauty of
snow covering an otherwise colourless landscape. Snow dusting the branches
of bare trees, highlights the simple elegance of branches, in all their
fractal variations.
