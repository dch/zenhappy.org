Late Summer fruit is like nothing else on earth. Juice drips down my face,
succulent nectarines, plump peaches, luscious raspberries and blueberries
so tender and sweet. The best fruit are homegrown. As a kid I would pluck
them from plum trees, apricots, peaches, apples, lemons and grapefruit.
Paradise in a Practical Package.
