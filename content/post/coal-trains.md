There's no denying it, trains are cool, in some undefinable fashion. And
the coolest of them all must surely be the coal train, endless carriages
of the excavations of the dusty bowels of the earth, where humanity has
deeply scarred and forever crippled the natural landscape.

I no longer know where the coal goes, but as a child it was the hot topic,
as coal meant jobs, and jobs meant holidays, relaxed parents, and presents.

Today the coal is dusted by fresh falling snow, and the surfaces of each
lump glisten slightly in the sheen left by snowflakes that have been
sacrified by their later brethren, giving their form to cool down the coal
to a point where it offers no resistance.
