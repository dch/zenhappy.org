We went camping once and stayed in an old cabin by a lake. It was a
long way from town and it was really late when we got there.
For some reason, we had to walk a long way down the road to
pick up the key or something. Mum and I walked back under the stars,
without a torch. The view of the Milky Way and the stars and planets
around us was stunning.
