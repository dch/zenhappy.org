On the importance of giving hugs, with due respect to [Oscar Wilde].

A hug costs nothing, except the instant when time hangs still, and we
pause in simply appreciating the other person for being there with us.
It's especially poignant with my children, who rush in the morning for
their hugs, or at the end of the day after daycare, to re-affirm
their love, in a truly zen happy moment.
