My first post here was about my earliest memories, walking with my dad.
I'm spending time with my sons, and really hope that all the walks and
bike rides we've been doing in the hot summer sun, in the parks and
playgrounds, splashing in the river, that some of that delight also
sticks.

It's only later, as parents, that we truly begin to appreciate what
we gained as children, and what we sometimes lose or lack in adulthood.
This year has definitely been about discovery, and personal growth. And
a large part of that is about listening to the Zen masters that are my
children, that remind me on a daily basis how to live simply, well, and
above all, Happy.
